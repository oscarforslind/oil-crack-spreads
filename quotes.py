"""Quote storage for refined products.

Prices arrive as parallel lists of dates and values, which is fragile: the link
between a date and its price is positional, so a single dropped element silently
misaligns everything after it. This module converts those into a dict keyed by
(product, date), where the two cannot drift apart, and provides the two readers
the rest of the project needs.
